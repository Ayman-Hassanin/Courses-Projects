# Courses-Projects
This is to mention that I did about three different projects using PYTHON on Coursera.<br />
Unfortunately, we cannot share them, so I thought of highlighting some of them here.<br />
One project was a Word Cloud. (Crash Course on Python, Link: https://coursera.org/share/8e3c8986d983957cfdfb98cdd973f585)<br />
Another one was a simplified version of the game "Wheel of Fortune". (Python Classes and Inheritance, Link: https://coursera.org/share/a14be0b490076d46ca87a19578e834af)
